# Railway-Performance-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Power-BI

*Completed the project on Railway Performance Analysis using Microsoft Power BI*

**RAILWAY PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:** 

*Client requirement: Need to Analyze overall performance of Top 5 train Types and 4 big railway station*

**PROJECT ROADMAP**

**Data Scrubbing using Power Query**
1) Splitting Columns by Delimiter 
2) Removing unused column Data Modelling 

**DATA MODELLING:**
1)Design Calendar Dimension – this will be creating using the DAX.

**Designing of Measures**
1) On-Time Arrival 
2) Late Arrival
3) Revenue Earned – Total Revenue
4) % of Revenue Earned by different train types 
5) % of Train Traffic at different Railway Stations 
6) % of Revenue Earned Location wise 
7) Satisfaction by Train Type 

**Data Visualization**
1) KPI (Total Revenue Earned, Different Train Types, Total Stations Covered) 
2) Maps (% of Revenue Earned Location wise) 
3) Pie/Donut Chart (% of Revenue Earned by different train types, % of Train Traffic at different Railway Stations) 
4) Line Chart (Revenue Earned over Time) 
5) Column Chart (On-Time vs Late Arrival by Train Type) 
6) Bar Chart (Satisfaction by train type) 
7) Filter (Period)
